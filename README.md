#### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!  I'm Maria, an eager full-stack software development student at Business College Helsinki.
 
ðŸš€ I've now transitioned from the healthcare field into the world of code, and here you'll find my journey. From school assignments and tutorials to more personal projects, I'm excited to share my evolving portfolio with you.

ðŸ’» My toolkit includes C#, HTML, CSS, React, ASP.NET, Azure, and SQL.

ðŸ’¬ I'm always open to learn more and to hear your thoughts on my code, so don't hesitate to get in touch if you have input.
